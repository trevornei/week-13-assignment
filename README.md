    - Using Create-React-App or Vite, create a new React project. Create a LoginForm component that contains the following:
    - Username and password input fields, an h3 that says Log In, with a border. Style the component using the default generated CSS file.
    - Create a Navigation component that contains links styled like a navbar.
    - The links don't have to go anywhere.
    - Put the Navigation component at the top of the page and the LoginForm in the center of the page.
